    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will look at three bad visualizations then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify what makes them bad\n",
    "1. Use the same data to make a better chart\n",
    "1. Explain an interesting pattern you noticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some helpful questions to determine if a visualization is bad:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the visualization trying to show? Ex. Comparison? Relationship? Change over time?\n",
    "2. Is this the right visualization to use?\n",
    "3. Does the visualization have the correct labels and axes limits?\n",
    "4. Is there too much being shown in one visualization? Should it be split?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some helpful questions to find patterns in a visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do different data points compare? Are there significant differences? Are there any outliers?\n",
    "2. If comparing data/series, how do they rank? Is there a significant difference between rankings?\n",
    "3. If looking at data over time, is there any seasonality? How do the values compare to the mean and/or median? How do the values change over time? Ex. Ups and downs? Always up? Always down?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture on data visualization (available in the usual places) has a lot of code examples.  Also don't forget the matplotlib documentation available from the Help menu in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this is the first assignment we've given where we ask you to provide text answers and not just code. You don't have to get fancy, but you'll want to use Markdown to write up your answers.  There is Markdown help available from the Help menu as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "For grading purposes, we will clear all outputs from all your cells and then run them all from the top.  Please test your notebook in the same fashion before turning it in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting Your Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit your notebook, first clear all the cells (this won't matter too much this time, but for larger data sets in the future, it will make the file smaller).  Then use the File->Download As->Notebook to obtain the notebook file.  Finally, submit the notebook file on Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credits\n",
    "\n",
    "Many thanks to Saad Elbeleidy for this assignment!"

    "Now we need to plot the data over different panels. We can use [`plt.subplots`](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.subplots) to create multiple panels. Since we have 4 products, we're going to need 4 panels on top of each other. `subplots` returns two variables, the figure object and an array of axes. What we can do is loop through each Axes object and create a plot for that product. The first Axes object should plot the first product, the second should plot the second product and so on.\n",

These buffers are simply integers that extend the y axis above the highest value in the products, and below the lowest.\n",

For example, if you only want to change the hspace of the subplots, you can call `fig.subplot_adjust(hspace=0.6)` without specifying the other arguments. Just be sure to label the argument you want to specify. Don't just write `fig.subplot_adjust(0.6)`"
