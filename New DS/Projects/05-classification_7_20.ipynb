    "\n",
    "On April 15, 1912, the largest passenger liner ever made collided with an iceberg during her maiden voyage. When the Titanic sank it killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck resulted in such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n",

The columns describe different attributes about the person including whether they survived (`0=No`), their age, their passenger-class (`1=1st Class, Upper`), gender, and the fare they paid (Â£s*).

    "1. What was the model/algorithm that performed best for you?\n",
    "For me the LogisticRegression worked the best followed closely by KNN Classifier worked best with an R-Squared Score of 0.791 and .790 respectively.  \n",
    "2. What feaures and parameters were used to achieve that performance?\n",
    "I used 'Pclass', 'Age', 'female', 'male' however if I were to use just male or female The model would lose a bit of accuracy so I included both I dont know why this is as they contain the same info.\n",
    "3. What insights did you gain from your experimentation about the predictive power of this dataset and did it match your original hypothesis about the relationship between given feature data and the target?\n",
    "I was close with my prediction. The highest survival rate was elderly women in 1st class and girls in 2nd class\n"
